WEEK 3 MINUTES

Attendees: Andrei, Daniel, Mary, Minghan (Remote), Xuechi (Remote)

This week, we started scanning objects to use as pre-set data. It took most of thhe lab to adjust the code and have it scan in the directions we wanted,
but we still managed to get 3 scans of a coffee cup.

The UI was also started - displaying a 'scan' button, a 'checkout' button and a designated space for information about objects/products to be displayed.

Next week, we will continue scanning the preset data and work on integrating the UI and hardware.

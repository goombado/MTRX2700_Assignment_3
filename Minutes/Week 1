WEEK 1 MINUTES

Attendees: Andrei, Daniel, Mary, Minghan (Remote), Xuechi (Remote)

This lab, we brainstormed ideas for the major project, ultimately deciding to create and implement an object detection method used for 
barcodless scanning. The harware module would require the use of both servo motors and the the lidar sensor to scan the object. This data 
will then be interpreted and sent to the computer interface to be displayed to customers. This design allows for possible extensions such 
as the use of the 7-segs, sound playing and adding the use of buttons to the functionality.

After creating a high level overview of our design, we decided that the remote students should focus on the UI (computer interface) and 
on-campus students to focus on the hardware interface as on-campus students have access to the hardware.

We finished the lab by finalising our design so that we can present it to the tutors next lab

WEEK 2 MINUTES

Attendees: Andrei, Daniel, Mary, Minghan (Remote), Xuechi (Remote)

This week we presented our high-level design idea to the tutors for feedback and to ensure it is an achievable goal.

We then begun testing the hardware to figure out how to control the servos as this will be the basis of our scanning function. 

We also modularised our design to help break it down and delegate roles in the future.

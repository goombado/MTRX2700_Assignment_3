WEEK 4 MINUTES

Attendees: Andrei, Daniel, Mary, Minghan (Remote), Xuechi (Remote)

We experienced a major setback this week. We spent the whole lab debugging the code we used last week, attempting to make it work in the exact same way.
Strangely, running the exact same code on the same hardware using the same interface was just not working, even though it did last week. We tested 
the code on different PTUs and dragonboards to rule out any hardware problems and ultimately decided that we would have to start over and rewrite all of 
our code from the previous week.

Simultaneously, we worked on integrating serial and our user interface to help prepare for the overall integration of all of our modules. 

We plan on maintianing constant communication throughout the week so that once we have the scans of the objects, we can integrate all of our modules and 
be ready for our presentation on tuesday.
